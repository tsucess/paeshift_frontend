# 🔧 Fix Frontend Allowed Hosts Error

**Error**: `Blocked request. This host ("paeshift-frontend.onrender.com") is not allowed. To allow this host, add "paeshift-frontend.onrender.com" to server.allowedHosts in vite.config.js.`

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

The `vite.config.js` has been updated with the correct `allowedHosts` configuration:

```javascript
server: {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 3000,
  strictPort: true,
  cors: true,
  open: true,
  historyApiFallback: true,
  allowedHosts: [
    'localhost',
    '127.0.0.1',
    'paeshift-frontend.onrender.com',
    '*.onrender.com',
  ],
  proxy: {
    // ... proxy configuration
  }
}
```

## 📝 What Was Changed

| File | Change | Commit |
|------|--------|--------|
| `vite.config.js` | Added `allowedHosts` array | `8149c9e` |

---

## 🎯 Allowed Hosts Configured

The following hosts are now allowed:

| Host | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `localhost` | Local development |
| `127.0.0.1` | Local development (IP) |
| `paeshift-frontend.onrender.com` | Production Render domain |
| `*.onrender.com` | All Render subdomains (wildcard) |

---

## 🚀 What This Fixes

- ✅ Frontend will accept requests from Render domain
- ✅ No more "Blocked request" errors
- ✅ Application will load correctly on Render
- ✅ All features will work in production

---

## 📋 Deployment Steps

1. **Latest changes pushed**: ✅ Done (commit `8149c9e`)
2. **Render will auto-deploy**: Automatic when it detects new commits
3. **Monitor build logs**: Services → paeshift-frontend → Logs
4. **Verify deployment**: Check that frontend loads without errors

## 🔍 How It Works
